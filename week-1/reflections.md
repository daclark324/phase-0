# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about a variety of time management and productivity ideas including, meditation, how mindfulness can improve productivity and focus, habits and the growth mindset, Pomodoro techniques and time boxing, the Fogg behavioral method, counter-intuitive productivity and tricks for getting in the zone at work. I found similarities in many of the strategies/methods such as the idea of being mindful and objective about the work, breaking down goals into manageable/micro tasks and the use of time boxing. Time Boxing, which is the underlying concept of the Pomodoro technique and other time-segmented activities like speed-dating, is the process of dedicating on a chunk of time to applying steady work toward completion of a goal but rather than continuing to work until the goal is achieved, at the end of the time box you stop working and assess the recently completed time chunk.  My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is a mix of some of the strategies presented in the post. I usually attempt to set time boxes for accomplishing certain tasks but also embrace the times and cycles where I am experiencing “flow” and work towards completion rather than a set time. I utilize lists and attempt to get granular on specific tasks rather than attempt to tackle entire projects without breaking them down. This also helps serve as an outline/overview of a project as I am able to identify the core components before diving into the work. Though, the article that resonated most was the one about counterintuitive tips for productivity. For as long as I can remember I have worked on my own schedule, embracing the ebbs and flow in my mood and working when I am motivated to maximize productivity. I always thought of this as a negative strategy so it was nice to see that others don’t necessarily view it as such. However, I also acknowledge that some of my behaviors definitely can be improved upon such as procrastinating on items I don’t want to do. To overcome this, I plan on breaking everything down into micro-items to gain momentum as well as employ the strategy of making items painful not to do. Finally, I plan on engaging in more structured mediation sessions. While I frequently engage in open-minded meditation, I believe that getting on a more consistent and regular schedule, as well as integrating focused-meditation, will benefit me.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a vehicle that executes commands. It can be used both for a command interpreter and a programming language. Shells can be used interactively or non-interactively and allows execution of GNU commands, both synchronously and asynchronously. Bash is the default shell for the GNU operating system. While I was able to use all the commands covered, the most challenging parts of the exercise were removing directories and understanding the difference between copying and moving files/directories. I think all of the commands covered are crucial for individuals just starting out like me, particularly the ones relating to navigating, like ‘cd’ and ‘cd ..’, and understanding where you are, like ‘pwd’.

* pwd: prints the working directory
* ls: lists the contents of the directory
* mv: moves a file or directory (renames it)
* cd: changes the directory
* ../: moves to the last directory (next parent directory/go "up" one folder)
* touch: creates or updates a file
* mkdir: makes a directory
* less: pages through a file
* rmdir: removes a directory
* rm: removes a file
* help: displays helpful information about commands, or commands matching a pattern if specified.
