? Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a new repository, or repo, first log into GitHub and go to 'Your Profile'. Next, locate the '+' to the left your profile avatar and click to select a "New Repository". Enter the desired name for the repositroy, adjust any permissions as necessary and add any desired licenses.

To clone the new repository, use the terminal to navigate to the folder where you want the repository to appear locally on your computer. Then, find the 'HTTPS clone URL' of your repository from the repository page on GitHub. It will be located in the lower right portion of your screen. Once located, copy the URL. Return to the terminal and type 'git clone' and paste the URL then hit return.


? Describe what open source means.

Open source is the practice of sharing how a program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit. When used with proper licensing, it allows for the author to retain ownership and copyright while allowing others to view, modify and contribute to their code without requesting special permissions.


? What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think so long as Open Source is used as a resource and not a crutch to stand on or tool to be used without understanding what you're looking at, it is a very valuable system.


? Assess the importance of using licenses.

It is imperative to use licenses with your projects because it allows you to retain all your rights and the original copyright while granting others permission to use that work. It is better than releasing work into the public domain because it protects your rights and requires you be listed as the original author and is far more time efficient than granting special permissions on a case-by-case basis.


? What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I did not have any "aha" moments, though the processes we worked on before, such as cloning, adding, commiting and pushing, were definitely reinforced. I didn't struggle on any one facet in particular, just need to make sure I'm remaining mindful of what I'm doing.



? Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Not yet! Still a little overwhelmed at all the resources I've been directed at through DBC!
